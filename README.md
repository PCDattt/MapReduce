# ðŸ—‚ Go MapReduce Project

A collection of high-performance, idiomatic Go implementations of the **MapReduce** pattern â€” designed to demonstrate mastery of concurrency, channel communication, and real-world data processing in Go.

This project is crafted as part of a portfolio to showcase backend and systems programming skills using Go â€” with a focus on correctness, performance, and idiomatic code structure.

## ðŸ§  Versions Included

This repository contains two primary versions of the MapReduce pattern:

- **ðŸ”¹ Synchronous version:**  
  A straightforward, single-threaded implementation with sequential map and reduce logic. Useful as a baseline for benchmarking and correctness.

- **ðŸ”¹ Concurrent version:**  
  A fully concurrent, idiomatic Go implementation using goroutines, channels, `sync.WaitGroup`, and `sync.Mutex` â€” scalable and efficient on large inputs.

These versions allow direct performance comparison and highlight how Go handles concurrency with elegance and minimal overhead.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… **Pure Go** â€” built entirely with the standard library, no third-party dependencies
- âœ… **Idiomatic concurrency** â€” uses goroutines, channels, and synchronization patterns idiomatically
- âœ… **Real-world use cases** â€” word counting, log analysis, sales data aggregation, text indexing
- âœ… **Benchmark-ready** â€” compare sync vs concurrent performance on large files
- âœ… **Flexible input** â€” supports file-based or in-memory data
- âœ… **Buffered channel support** â€” experiment with backpressure and throughput tuning
